An endless runner game I developed in a few weeks for a school project. This was my first dip into developing for mobile, and I also was able to hook it up with a web database and get it onto the google play store in a pre-release state.
As of writing this, I don't have much interest in continuing development on the project. It still served as a useful learning experience though.
